# Twitter Bot
A twitter bot for my main account. Requires [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy), which can be installed using:
```
pip install tweepy
```
and a separate file named `config.py` with Twitter Dev tokens required for authentification.

My twitter can be found [@TheNicGard](https://twitter.com/TheNicGard).
